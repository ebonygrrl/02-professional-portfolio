# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Description

The goal of this assignment was to build a portfolio page I can add to as the course progresses. In addition to building this online portfolio, I will be applying the core skills I've recently learned which are flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.
